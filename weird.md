# A COMPUTER SCIENCE THEORY OF ETERNITY

## Side Thoughts on Using C.S. to Model Humans as Beings Distinct from Bodies

#### David Oliver Doswell

> Suppositions

- Physics is a crude atomic programming interface (ATPI) for the known universe

- There is no beginning to the known universe

- The observable universe is a physical observation

- Time is a physical construct

- Time does not exist in non-physical constructs

- Human animals are physical constructs

- Human “beings” are non-physical constructs

- “Beings” (Entities) exist inside of (bodies) and outside of time


#### Primitives

- Code that outputs biological life to “Beings”

- Redefine death as a “Transition Display Module”

- Establish eternity exists in a poorly understood visual interface adjacent the
physical universe, via an ATPI.

> Establish: Dimension. Existence. Body. Consciousness. Communication. Runtime.
