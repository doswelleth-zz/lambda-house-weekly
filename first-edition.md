# SCHOOL IS HARD

I said that to my good friend, Joe, in a text message, and he scoffed, “School is not hard… school is a filter to see who can commit to something and who can’t.”

I initially found the response vanquishing and militant, as if I were applying to _Treadstone_ to help take down Carlos the Jackal.

His response both angered and accelerated me to persist the next day. I replied, “I can and I will,” with the gusto of a young cadet who doesn’t stop to think that his flag is made out of the same material as the enemy’s. My reply to Joe was at best ambitious.

This is the third week at Lambda School and we could slowly peel the skin from our faces and feel nothing. Maybe it's me but I am uncertain as to what has been particularly difficult this week. It's always bunker mud and stinky boots. However feeling like you can't cut it is soul-crushing and requires more than a mental model for success (see: **Feature Requests**).

And we haven’t scaled a month with 6 more to go. But it’s Friday. I personally have a half bottle of Côtes du Rhône and what a parent might describe as an I don’t care attitude. I am rather interested in a walk and talk with a beautiful woman. Maybe visit the bodega on Mission. Or an acupuncturist. Or an exorcist.

Thoughts and prayers to my housemates, most of whom are still working on their Sprint 3 Challenge post-submission time. Dinner should be replete with various odors from all the diets with a dash of vitriol about the origins of pedagogy.

# I LOVE SAN FRANCISCO

San Francisco is high on pot and its own self-worth. That may be earned but it doesn’t account for the intoxicating smell of fresh poop next to the comic book store on Mission Street. Or Louis Vuitton in Union Square. I hear Golden State Park is nice.

I met a platonic gay thruple in the Castro neighborhood who could have only been more pretentious if I were dead. Reverting to the mean, most people are appropriately kind but then on their way. I am reliably blinded by the sun that gives them all a glow I fantasized could only exist in California. Dreams do come true.

Shout out to the guy sleeping 5 yards from my gated residence to whose couch pillow I gifted a former housemate’s hoody. He wasn’t there when I first arrived to drop it off but that shit was gone after class when I furtively peeked out the window some hours later. I saw him under the tree wrapped in it that night. We can do better, SF.   

The House is collectively owned(?) and operated by The Group (alias to protect the innocent). This Group is identifiably nice but were unannounced upon my arrival. My Lambda Housemates, too, were unaware of their presence let alone their authority. That would explain the random shoe-and-sockless pop-ins and seeming disregard for my personal space. The Group's comms, C. - super cool - recently blasted welcome emails which my account appropriately associated with the junk I never see. The email itemized what effectively may be called the Rules of the House. I am now confused by which rules to break (hipster backyard **ragers**!) and which to follow (no pets).

A shiny new housemate arrived Saturday morning: professional, ex-military, easy personality. He bought the same milk as A. (name abbreviated to protect the innocent), which is the kind of thing you discuss when various people share the same food preservation technology. A spawn of The Group, S. seems to be getting on fine with my housemates.

# ANONYMOUS

**A 4th Working Burner** Building guy came this Friday morning. Rang the doorbell 5 times while I was figuring out the data type to my JSONDecoder(). Scared the shit out of me. He was nice, barely spoke English, laughed after every unintelligible sentence, and only capped 1 of 2 no-pilot burners.

**Conversations with...** Generally Housemates prefer exploring San Francisco on weekends, shopping at Trader Joes, and navigating the stench of pot and poop as God intended. But it would be cracking if we had an hour once a month, Saturday or Sunday, with a prominent founder or iOS engineer.   

**Dining Area** We will probably combine unused work desks for the kitchen but this was brought up. 3 of us are just big guys and require more space. 2 of us could have won The Battle of Bannockburn with William Wallace.

**School Psychologist** PMs are not motivators or comforters (though ours, J. M., is the next best thing to a young doctor with an exquisite bedside manner). Shout out to S. C.

A proper mental health professional is expensive. And maybe not necessary. But I imagine there are people who would like to talk to someone without feeling like they’re being handled and put back on the horse by an instructor or project manager.
