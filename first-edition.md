# A SPRINT IS NOT A MARATHON

The popular saying, paraphrased above, to encourage long-term thinking, is only
encouraging after the fact. It is not particularly helpful in the moment. The
thick of trial and tribulation is an atmosphere not dissimilar to Karl The Fog:
chilly, out of context, notably distracting when you need to see things clearly.

This week's Sprint Challenge should be no different than last week's in that it
was a _Sprint Challenge_. Every week at Lambda School we are (somewhat) evaluated
on our weekly progress to assess our readiness to move on to the next week. I was...
not ready. To be honest, I am beginning to feel a little overwhelmed. The slanted
issue I am facing is my shortcomings have nothing to do with the lessons taught.

The instructor is exceptional.

I understand what I am hearing except being asked to reproduce it is like the Kevin
Hart bit with the remedial student. A young child is told what the answer is to 1 + 1
after having the base 10 numeral system explained to him (1, 2, 3... etc.)

However, when asked to repeat the answer, upon being asked, the child weeps incessantly
before declaring "I don't know!!!," without guile, as if he hadn't recently been taught
how to think about the problem.

I feel, as my housemate remarked, "You should be coding, right now!," that I should
be coding right now, to better refine what I have been teaching myself for 3 years.

I know this stuff but I don't test well. I'm like the remedial student except instead
of crying, I pregame in my bedroom like a bridesmaid, go to the Haight, and look for
trouble. But I have to think long term and what is best for my education. This is only
week 3 and I am already complaining.

This week's Sprint challenge was a big fat incomplete, resulting in my (maybe!) having
to repeat the week, again. I am working to prove that I am in need of no such thing by
rebuilding the projects from scratch and completing them. I wish they asked me 'What is
1 + 1.' That would demonstrate my genius.

# TCHAIKOVSKY SYMPHONY 4

Ah, late 19th century Moscow. The cold. The Byzantine architecture. The grandeur of
the cupolas. The posterity soon to relish the beauty of the symphony as they nosh on
buttery Welsh cakes. Yes, a cohort of Lambda House students may be found sat around a
vintage record player spinning the albums of the masters in their blue jeans. They may
also be stuffed with fried British staples with little regard for their cholesterol or
the people sleeping downstairs.

The Monero Meetup one housemate attended was profitable. Heaps of good information from
one visible community Schelling point, known on Twitter as Fluffy Pony. Having recently
attended a conference in Panama, it is not surprising to hear many wealthy individuals
define crypto, as Pony related, as "the new offshore." Seeing different aspects of San
Francisco is interesting. So many little neighborhoods doing so many different things.
But they all unify around a common good: unlike the technical knowledge (and wealth) of
crypto, the smell of poop and pot is evenly distributed.

Let's be clear: Lambda House students do not own their House. We are fortunate to be here.
And we are not lost on that fact. However, it is always... an adaptive segue from living
on your own (or even with other people) to having your landlord show your living quarters
to whom you would call strangers without warning. It's like living in a menagerie except
no one feeds you or washes you up, which is a total ripoff.

Speaking of The Group, the weekend get-togethers continue. Lambda House kids are squarely
uninvited though we would probably not be turned away were we to crash the party (as I had
a few weeks ago). But the kids are starting to feel it. Sure, we make our own fun, on and off
premise, but we are pariahs. The Group is distant and civil as if we were terminally ill.
Group spawn, A. and S., however, who co-exist with us, are solid. And to be honest so are
the others. Plainly, there is no need for The Group to invest any quality time into us, as
our days are numbered (more on that, later).

**Mail Forwarding** A housemate and I have enjoyed the quality of bedding and home magazines
that arrive 1 to 2 times per week from previous residents. I imagine a young D.I.N.K. (Dual
Income No Kids) couple, planning a family, deciding San Francisco was too expensive a place
to raise a child, and saying 'Fuck that, we out, baby!' without canceling their subscription
to Country Sampler.

# SCHOOL IS HARD

I said that to my good friend, Joe, in a text message, and he scoffed, “School is not hard… school is a filter to see who can commit to something and who can’t.”

I initially found the response vanquishing and militant, as if I were applying to _Treadstone_ to help take down Carlos the Jackal.

His response both angered and accelerated me to persist the next day. I replied, “I can and I will,” with the gusto of a young cadet who doesn’t stop to think that his flag is made out of the same material as the enemy’s. My reply to Joe was at best ambitious.

This is the third week at Lambda School and we could slowly peel the skin from our faces and feel nothing. Maybe it's me but I am uncertain as to what has been particularly difficult this week. It's always bunker mud and stinky boots. However feeling like you can't cut it is soul-crushing and requires more than a mental model for success (see: **Feature Requests**).

And we haven’t scaled a month with 6 more to go. But it’s Friday. I personally have a half bottle of Côtes du Rhône and what a parent might describe as an I don’t care attitude. I am rather interested in a walk and talk with a beautiful woman. Maybe visit the bodega on Mission. Or an acupuncturist. Or an exorcist.

Thoughts and prayers to my housemates, most of whom are still working on their Sprint 3 Challenge post-submission time. Dinner should be replete with various odors from all the diets with a dash of vitriol about the origins of pedagogy.

# I LOVE SAN FRANCISCO

San Francisco is high on pot and its own self-worth. That may be earned but it doesn’t account for the intoxicating smell of fresh poop next to the comic book store on Mission Street. Or Louis Vuitton in Union Square. I hear Golden State Park is nice.

I met a platonic gay thruple in the Castro neighborhood who could have only been more pretentious if I were dead. Reverting to the mean, most people are appropriately kind but then on their way. I am reliably blinded by the sun that gives them all a glow I fantasized could only exist in California. Dreams do come true.

Shout out to the guy sleeping 5 yards from my gated residence to whose couch pillow I gifted a former housemate’s hoody. He wasn’t there when I first arrived to drop it off but that shit was gone after class when I furtively peeked out the window some hours later. I saw him under the tree wrapped in it that night. We can do better, SF.   

One of my new housemates is a shake-up. She's not a Lambda House I Rebel fighting for justice, and indeed not a male. She is associated with The Group (alias to protect the innocent), a professional cohort whom, too, rents and sublets space(s). She is accomplished, funny, and smiles like she enjoys it, which beats the Halloween imagery of Lambda kids when we first wake up.    

The House may be collectively owned(?) and operated by The Group. This Group is identifiably nice but were unannounced upon my arrival. My Lambda Housemates, too, were unaware of their presence let alone their authority. That would explain the random shoe-and-sockless pop-ins and seeming disregard for my personal space. The Group's comms, C., recently blasted welcome emails which my account appropriately associated with the junk I never see. The email itemized what effectively may be called the Rules of the House. I am now confused by which rules to break (hipster backyard ragers!) and which to follow (no pets).

A shiny new housemate arrived Saturday morning: professional, ex-military, easy personality. He bought the same milk as A. (name abbreviated to protect the innocent), which is the kind of thing you discuss when various people share the same food preservation technology. A spawn of The Group, S. seems to be getting on fine with my housemates.

**A 4th Working Burner** Building guy came this Friday morning. Rang the doorbell 5 times while I was figuring out the data type to my JSONDecoder(). Scared the shit out of me. He was nice, barely spoke English, laughed after every unintelligible sentence, and only capped 1 of 2 no-pilot burners.

**Conversations with...** Generally Housemates prefer exploring San Francisco on weekends, shopping at Trader Joes, and navigating the stench of pot and poop as God intended. But it would be cracking if we had an hour once a month, Saturday or Sunday, with a prominent founder or iOS engineer.   

**Dining Area** We will probably combine unused work desks for the kitchen but this was brought up. 3 of us are just big guys and require more space. 2 of us could have won The Battle of Bannockburn with William Wallace.

**School Psychologist** PMs are not motivators or comforters (though ours, J. M., is the next best thing to a young doctor with an exquisite bedside manner). Shout out to S. C.

A proper mental health professional is expensive. And maybe not necessary. But I imagine there are people who would like to talk to someone without feeling like they’re being handled and put back on the horse by an instructor or project manager.
